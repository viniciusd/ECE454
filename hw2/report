The final solution performs better than the others after two main modifications: tiling and code motion. First of all, tiling was applied to better use the cache memory, decreasing the miss rate. We used different tilings, looking for the size that better fits on the machine's cache. In addition, code motion decreased the number of operations performed inside the inner loops, avoiding repeated evaulations. In conclusion, these modifications improved the function performance in a factor of 2.9.
